### VR Lab 2

Potential App Concept

Using this technology and an image tracking model such as the one demonstrated in my prototype developers could use this as an interactive model in a medical training setting in which students could have an image of a patient and when the AR device is  directed at an injury it could display text and solutions for that injury, or display options and results for an interactive idea for potential student training solutions. This way the students would have interactive live feedback and be able to have a more realistic hands on application of their skills.
